It needs a capable GPU to run models (**at least 4GB VRAM**).\n\nYou can explore the variety of models available through Ollama here:\n\n![pic10.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic10.png?raw=True)\n\n### <a id='toc1_5_2_'></a>[Why Use Code (API) for Data Mining?](#toc0_)\n\nFor data analysis, accessing LLMs programmatically is superior to using web chatbots because it allows for:\n*   **Automation:** Easily process entire datasets with loops.\n*   **Structured Output:** Receive data in usable formats like **JSON**, ready for analysis in tools like pandas.\n*   **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results by setting fixed parameters.\n*   **Privacy:** Maintain data security, especially when running models locally.\n\nFor the main exercises in this lab, we will use **the Gemini API**. This approach offers several advantages over running local open-source models, such as access to state-of-the-art model performance without needing specialized hardware. While the API has usage limits (rate limits and token quotas), it provides a generous **free tier** that is more than sufficient for our exercises.\n\n![pic13.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic13.png?raw=True)\n\n![pic14.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic14.png?raw=True)\n\n### <a id='toc1_5_3_'></a>[The Gemini API](#toc0_)\n\nWe will primarily use the **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) model. As shown in the rate limit table, this model is optimized for high-frequency tasks and offers a high request-per-day limit of 1,000, making it ideal for completing the lab exercises without interruption.\n\nStudents are encouraged to explore other models available through the API but should remain mindful of their respective usage limits. For instance:\n*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is a more powerful model but has a lower daily request limit of 100.\n*   The **Gemma 3** model available via the API offers an impressive 14,400 requests per day, providing another excellent alternative for experimentation.\n\nPlease be aware of your usage limits as you work through the exercises to ensure you do not get rate-limited.\n\n[Gemini Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)\n\n[Gemini Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)\n\n[Description of Gemini Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### <a id='toc1_5_4_'></a>[Interacting with the Gemini API](#toc0_)\n\nThe code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n\nBefore you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n\n*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n\n*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n\n*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n\nIn the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n\nIf needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\nuser_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\n\n\n# System instruction that can dictate how the model behaves in the output, can be customized as needed\nSYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = (\n        \"You are a helpful assistant\"\n    )\n\n# Max amount of tokens that the model can output, the Gemini 2.5 Models have this maximum amount\n# For other models need to check their documentation \nMAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 65535\nMODEL_NAME = \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\" #

For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n\nThe key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n\nIn the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n*   The **attributes** of the class (e.g., `topic_name`, `sub_title`) become the keys in the final JSON object.\n*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n\nWe can even nest these classes inside one another to create complex, hierarchical JSON structures. This allows us to precisely control the format of the output, transforming the LLM from a simple text generator into a reliable tool for automated and structured data extraction.\n\n[Gemini's Structured Output Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output)\n\nFor data validation of schemas Gemini API uses the Pydantic library, for more documentation on it you can check: [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) \n\n[JSON Format Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# We define our structure schema that Gemini should follow for the output response\n\n# Subsections on the topics we query ->定義物件範本\nclass Subsection(BaseModel):\n    sub_title: str\n    sub_explanation: str\n\n# The top-level structure for the entire topic analysis ->定義物件範本\nclass Topic(BaseModel):\n    topic_name: str\n    subsections: list[Subsection]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T10:32:11.976090Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T10:32:11.976747Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T10:32:11.982246Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T10:32:11.976721Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T10:32:11.981426Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"input_prompt = [\"Explain what are machine learning, data centers, llms and how do they relate to each other.\"]\ntext_response = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = input_prompt, schema = list[Topic])\nprint(text_response)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T10:32:14.823622Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T10:32:14.823892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T10:32:18.339087Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T10:32:14.823873Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T10:32:18.338441Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[\n  {\n    \"topic_name\": \"Machine Learning\",\n    \"subsections\": [\n      {\n        \"sub_title\": \"Definition\",\n        \"sub_explanation\": \"Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

For \nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \nplanets. \nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth.

the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know.

For \nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \nthemselves and corridors spinning, <span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">without seeming unrealistic</span>. \n<span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">This brain-racking epic theme</span> is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \nplanets. \nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth.

Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n\nTheir key advantages are:\n\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n\n*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n\n<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercise in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>\n\n**Now let's generate some embeddings with Gemini for a sample of our dataset:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nimport pandas as pd\nimport time\nfrom google.api_core import exceptions\n\n# Let's define our function to get the embeddings with Gemini\ndef get_gemini_embedding(text: str, model: str=\"gemini-embedding-001\"):\n    try:\n        result = client.models.embed_content(model=model, contents=[text])\n        # 100 requests per minute limit -> 60s / 100 = 0.6s per request\n        # buffer time to avoid rate limits\n        time.sleep(0.6) #頻率控制，因為API有請求限制\n        return result.embeddings\n    except exceptions.ResourceExhausted as e:\n        print(f\"Rate limit exceeded.

(RAG)**](#toc0_)\n\n`NOTE: This whole section including the exercise is now considered a bonus section, not counted for the main grade.`\n\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n\nIn the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n\nIn this example we use the library langchain, for documentation on more functions of the library you can check the following link: [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n\n# Function to load, split, and retrieve documents\n#建立知識庫\ndef load_and_retrieve_docs(url):\n    loader = WebBaseLoader(\n        web_paths=(url,),\n        bs_kwargs=dict() \n    ) \n    docs = loader.load() #We will load the URL that will serve as our data source\n    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150) #We will divide the URL in chunks of text for easier comparison in the vector space\n    splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n    #print(splits) #You can print this to see how the chunks in the url where split\n    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/gemini-embedding-001\")\n    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings) #Our vector space for comparison\n    return vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\n#格式化retrieve到的資料，之後給prompt\ndef format_docs(docs):\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) #Format the retrieved docs in an orderly manner for prompting\n\n# Define the Gemini LLM function\ndef gemini_llm(question, context):\n    system_prompt = \"You are a RAG Agent that needs to provide a well structured answer based on the provided question and context.\"\n    formatted_prompt = f\"Question: {question}\\n\\nContext: {context}\"\n    response, logs = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = formatted_prompt, system_instruction = system_prompt, with_tokens_info = True)\n    print(f\"logs: \\n{logs}\")\n    # print(f\"Retrieved context: \\n{context}\\n\\n\") # You can print this to observe the retrieved context\n    return response\n\n\n# Define the RAG chain\ndef rag_chain(question, retriever):\n    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question)\n    formatted_context = format_docs(retrieved_docs)\n    return gemini_llm(question, formatted_context)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T10:37:14.183513Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T10:37:14.184050Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T10:37:14.205046Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T10:37:14.184030Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T10:37:14.204507Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":63},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import display, Markdown\nurl=\"https://qbotica.com/understanding-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-an-in-depth-overview/\"\n# Create the retriever\nretriever = load_and_retrieve_docs(url)\n\n# Use the RAG chain\nresult = rag_chain(question=\"What are the Key Challenges in Realizing AGI’s Full Potential\", retriever=retriever)\ndisplay(Markdown(result))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T10:37:16.889768Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T10:37:16.890358Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T10:37:19.157189Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T10:37:16.890336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T10:37:19.156629Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"logs: \n{'model': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'input_tokens': 726, 'output_tokens': 190}\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"The key challenges in realizing AGI's full potential stem from its fundamental requirements and the ethical considerations surrounding its development.

This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n\nIn this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n\n*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n\nTo make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n\n1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n\nWe will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n\n**Prompt Structure:**\n`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n\n\n<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercises in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Funciton for visualizing confusion_matrix\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\n\ndef plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes, title='Confusion matrix',\n                          cmap=sns.cubehelix_palette(as_cmap=True)):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function is modified from: \n    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html\n    \"\"\"\n    classes.sort()\n    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))    \n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5))\n    im = ax.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)\n    ax.figure.colorbar(im, ax=ax)\n    ax.set(xticks=np.arange(cm.shape[1]),\n           yticks=np.arange(cm.shape[0]),\n           xticklabels = classes,\n           yticklabels = classes,\n           title = title,\n           xlabel = 'Predicted label',\n           ylabel = 'True label')\n\n    fmt = 'd'\n    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt), horizontalalignment=\"center\", color=\"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n    ylim_top = len(classes) - 0.5\n    plt.ylim([ylim_top, -.5])\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T10:37:32.098269Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T10:37:32.098966Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T10:37:32.120543Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T10:37:32.098935Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T10:37:32.119677Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":66},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\nimport enum\nimport os\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport json\nimport time\n# Define the emotion labels\nemotions = ['anger', 'fear', 'joy', 'sadness']\n# Define the model to use for few-shot prompting\n\n# Schema for the output, the type enum can be used to make a pool of options if what we want is to classify our text selecting only one of them\nclass Emotions(enum.StrEnum):\n    ANGER = 'anger'\n    FEAR = 'fear'\n    JOY = 'joy'\n    SADNESS = 'sadness'\n\n\n# Function to handle the rate limits of gemini models\ndef handle_rate_limit(request_count, first_request_time, max_calls_per_min):\n    current_time = time.time()\n\n    # Initialize timer on the first request of a new window\n    if request_count == 0:\n        first_request_time = current_time\n\n    request_count += 1\n\n    # If the rate limit is reached\n    if request_count > max_calls_per_min:\n        elapsed_time = current_time - first_request_time\n        if elapsed_time < 60:\n            wait_time = 60 - elapsed_time\n            print(f\"Rate limit of {max_calls_per_min} requests per minute reached.

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
