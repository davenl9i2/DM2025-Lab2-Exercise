Large Language Models (LLMs)** - Expanded explanation](#toc0_)\n\nBefore we start we strongly suggest that you watch the following video explanations so you can understand the concepts that we are gonna discuss about extra LLMs concepts: \n\n1. [What Are Vision Language Models? How AI Sees & Understands Images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOD_EE96jhM)\n2. [How do Multimodal AI models work? Simple explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkoytlA3MoQ)\n3. [Multi-Modal LLMs for Image, Sound and Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sGwL6RAsUc&t=1137s)\n4. [What is Tool Calling? Connecting LLMs to Your Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8gMhXYAv1k)\n\n`These videos can help you get a better grasp on these additional concepts of LLMs covered in the bonus if you were not familiar before.`\n\n**So now let's start with the bonus content of Lab 2 Phase 2.**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate human language. Models like GPT and BERT excel at tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis due to their deep learning techniques and large-scale training. Recently these models got popular with the rise of Open-AI's ChatGPT and their different models, showcasing the potential of these models in a lot of aspects of our current society.\n\nOpen-source LLMs are cost-effective and customizable, with strong community support, but may underperform compared to proprietary models (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and require technical expertise to manage. Proprietary LLMs offer superior performance, ease of use, and regular updates, but can be costly, less flexible, and create dependency on external providers for ongoing access and updates.\n\nOf course. Here is a revised version that frames the explanation objectively, focusing on the practical advantages for a student working on data mining exercises and projects.\n\n### <a id='toc1_2_1_'></a>[Programmatic Access vs. Web Interfaces:](#toc0_)\n\nFor this data mining lab, we will interact with LLMs using code (programmatic access) rather than a web-based chatbot. This approach provides several direct advantages for completing your exercises and projects:\n\n*   **Process Datasets Automatically**: Instead of manually copying and pasting individual data points, you can use a simple `for` loop in your code to send every row of a dataset to the model. This allows you to perform tasks like sentiment analysis or data extraction on hundreds or thousands of records efficiently.\n\n*   **Get Structured, Usable Output**: A chatbot provides conversational text that is difficult to use in analysis. With an API, you can command the model to return its output in a specific **JSON format**. This structured data can be directly and reliably loaded into a **pandas DataFrame**, allowing you to immediately continue with your data analysis and visualization tasks.\n\n*   **Ensure Consistent and Reproducible Results**: Scientific and data mining work must be reproducible. By setting parameters like `temperature=0.0` in your code, you make the model's output deterministic. This means you will get the exact same result every time you run your script with the same input, which is essential for debugging your code and validating your findings.\n\n*   **Maintain Data Privacy**: If you work with sensitive or private datasets for a project, uploading that data to a public web interface is not secure. Using an API provides better data governance, and running a model locally with a tool like Ollama ensures your data **never leaves your computer**.\n\n### <a id='toc1_2_2_'></a>[Optional Notebook Material for Exploration - Open Source LLMs:](#toc0_)\n\nFor students interested in running models locally, the optional notebook `DM2025-Lab2-Optional-Ollama.ipynb` explores using Ollama ([Ollama GitHub Link](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)). Ollama is a powerful library that simplifies running a wide range of open-source LLMs. In that notebook, we will use the **Gemma 3 (4B)** for multi-modal tasks and advanced text-based tasks, **Gemma 3 (270M version)** for simple text-based tasks, **Llama 3.2 (1B version)** for tool calling tasks, and **embedding-gemma (300M params)** to generate embeddings from text data. The Gemma models come from Google's family of models, while Llama 3.2 comes from Meta's family, all of them open source.\n\nTo use these models effectively, an **NVIDIA GPU with at least 4 GB of VRAM is recommended**. If you don't have the required hardware, you can run the examples in Kaggle or other cloud notebooks with their free GPU usage tiers activated.\n\nYou can explore the variety of models available through Ollama here:\n\n![pic10.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic10.png?raw=True)\n\n#### <a id='toc1_2_2_1_'></a>[Parameters and Quantization](#toc0_)\n\nIn the image, you'll notice that models have a certain number of **parameters**. These are the internal variables the model learns during training, which store its knowledge. A higher parameter count generally leads to a more capable model but also increases its size and the computational resources needed to run it, especially VRAM.\n\nThis is where **quantization** becomes crucial. Quantization is a technique to reduce the memory footprint of a model by converting its parameters from high-precision data types (like 32-bit floating-point numbers) to lower-precision ones (like 8-bit integers). This process makes the model smaller and faster, significantly lowering VRAM usage, though it can sometimes cause a minor reduction in accuracy. Thanks to quantization, a 4-billion parameter model like Gemma 3 4B can be run on consumer-grade GPUs more efficiently.\n\n### <a id='toc1_2_3_'></a>[Proprietary LLMs: The Gemini API](#toc0_)\n\nFor the main exercises in this lab, we will use **the Gemini API**. This approach offers several advantages over running local open-source models, such as access to state-of-the-art model performance without needing specialized hardware. While the API has usage limits (rate limits and token quotas), it provides a generous **free tier** that is more than sufficient for our exercises.\n\n\n![pic13.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic13.png?raw=True)\n\n![pic14.png](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/pic14.png?raw=True)\n\nWe will primarily use the **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) model. As shown in the rate limit table, this model is optimized for high-frequency tasks and offers a high request-per-day limit of 1,000, making it ideal for completing the lab exercises without interruption.\n\nStudents are encouraged to explore other models available through the API but should remain mindful of their respective usage limits. For instance:\n*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is a more powerful model but has a lower daily request limit of 100.\n*   The **Gemma 3** model available via the API offers an impressive 14,400 requests per day, providing another excellent alternative for experimentation.\n\nPlease be aware of your usage limits as you work through the exercises to ensure you do not get rate-limited.\n\n[Gemini Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)\n\n[Gemini Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)\n\n[Description of Gemini Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### <a id='toc1_2_4_'></a>[Interacting with the Gemini API](#toc0_)\n\nThe code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n\nBefore you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n\n*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n\n*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n\n*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n\nIn the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n\nIf needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\nuser_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\n\n\n# System instruction that can dictate how the model behaves in the output, can be customized as needed\nSYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = (\n        \"You are a helpful assistant\"\n    )\n\n# Max amount of tokens that the model can output, the Gemini 2.5 Models have this maximum amount\n# For other models need to check their documentation \nMAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 65535\nMODEL_NAME = \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\" #

[Gemini's Segmentation Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding#segmentation)\n\nTo understand this process, it's helpful to remember how computer vision models \"see\" images. A model doesn't perceive a picture; it sees a grid of numbers (pixels). Traditional segmentation models are trained specifically to classify every single pixel in this grid, assigning it to a class (e.g., \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"background\"). This usually requires a highly specialized model trained on vast, manually labeled datasets.\n\nGemini offers a powerful alternative, performing this complex task without needing a specialized model. Its output, however, reflects these underlying computer vision principles. When asked to segment an image, Gemini returns a structured JSON list. For each detected object, it provides:\n\n*   **`\"box_2d\"`**: A bounding box with normalized coordinates `[y0, x0, y1, x1]`. Normalizing coordinates (scaling them to a standard range like 0-1000) is a common preprocessing step in machine learning that makes calculations consistent regardless of the original image size. Our code will need to \"de-normalize\" these coordinates back to the image's actual pixel dimensions.\n*   **`\"label\"`**: A text label identifying the object.\n*   **`\"mask\"`**: The segmentation mask itself, provided as a **base64 encoded PNG**. This encoding is a standard way to represent binary image data as a text string within a JSON response. The mask is not a simple binary outline but a **probability map**, where each pixel's brightness (0-255) represents the model's confidence that it belongs to the object.\n\nTherefore, to visualize the result, our code must perform a few key post-processing steps: decode the base64 string back into an image, resize this small mask to fit the dimensions of its bounding box, and finally, apply a confidence threshold (e.g., any pixel value > 127) to create the final binary mask.\n\nIf you are interested in the topic you can check these extra tutorials on image classification and segmentation: \n\n[PyTorch Image Classification](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification)\n\n[Train your image classifier model with PyTorch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/tutorials/pytorch-train-model)\n\n[Python | Image Classification using Keras](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/python-image-classification-using-keras/)\n\n[Image Segmentation using Python's scikit-image module](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/image-segmentation-using-pythons-scikit-image-module/)\n\n[Mediapipe | Image segmentation guide for Python](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/image_segmenter/python)\n\n**We are going to utilize the following image:**\n\n![example3.jpg](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/blob/main/pics/example3.jpg?raw=True)\n\nsource: https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-black-dog-and-orange-tabby-cat-fighting-on-the-road-10140894/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport io\nimport base64\nimport json\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom google.genai import types\nimport random\n\n# Schema for each element that is found inside the image\nclass Element(BaseModel):\n   label:str\n   box_2d: str\n   mask: str\n\ndef parse_json(json_output: str):\n  # Parsing out the markdown fencing\n  # Just as a double validation measure\n  lines = json_output.splitlines()\n  for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n    if line == \"```json\":\n      json_output = \"\\n\".join(lines[i+1:])  # Remove everything before \"```json\"\n      json_output = json_output.split(\"```\")[0]  # Remove everything after the closing \"```\"\n      break  # Exit the loop once \"```json\" is found\n  return json_output\n\ndef extract_segmentation_masks(image_path: str, items_to_detect: str, schema, model_name: str = \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\", output_dir: str = \"segmentation_outputs\"):\n  # Colors to draw the bounding boxes, masks and labels\n  HIGH_CONTRAST_COLORS = [\n      (255, 0, 0),      # Red\n      (0, 255, 0),      # Lime\n      (0, 0, 255),      # Blue\n      (255, 255, 0),    # Yellow\n      (0, 255, 255),    # Cyan\n      (255, 0, 255),    # Magenta\n      (255, 165, 0),    # Orange\n      (0, 128, 128),    # Teal\n      (128, 0, 128),    # Purple\n      (255, 192, 203),  # Pink\n      (0, 250, 154),    # Medium Spring Green\n      (255, 215, 0),    # Gold\n  ]\n  # Load and resize image\n  im = Image.open(image_path)\n  im.thumbnail([1024, 1024], Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n\n  prompt = f\"\"\"\n  Give the segmentation masks for the {items_to_detect}.\n  Output a JSON list of segmentation masks where each entry contains the 2D\n  bounding box in the key \"box_2d\", the segmentation mask in key \"mask\", and\n  the text label in the key \"label\".

This transforms audio recordings (like interviews, meetings, or customer service calls) from unstructured data into a text-based, analyzable format.\n\nThe process of working with audio in Gemini is very similar to video understanding, but simpler:\n\n*   **Similarities**: You provide audio files using the same two methods: **uploading them** via the File API for larger files or repeated use, or passing them **inline** for smaller, one-off analyses. You can also perform **timestamp-based analysis** (e.g., `02:30`), allowing you to query specific moments in an audio clip just as you would with a video.\n\n*   **Key Difference**: Audio processing is significantly less complex and **less token-intensive** than video. This is because it only involves a single stream of data (sound), whereas video requires processing both a visual track (frames) and an audio track.\n\n**Token Usage:** While more efficient than video, audio still consumes approximately **32 tokens per second**. The total length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours.\n\n[Gemini's Audio Understanding Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the following example we are using the audio extracted from Prof. Chen's Data Mining Lecture: [2025-ISA5810 Session 1 - Introduction and Data Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWnN4J7Zblw)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Schema for the output of our audio analysis\nclass Transcript(BaseModel):\n    timestamp: str\n    text: str\nclass AudioAnalysis(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    segment_transcript: list[Transcript]\n    complete_transcript: list[Transcript]\n\nexample_audio = client.files.upload(file=\"/kaggle/input/lab2-initial-data/audios/audio_example.mp3\")\nwait_until_file_is_active(client, example_audio)\n\nstart_segment = \"00:46\"\nend_segment = \"00:56\"\ntask = \\\n        f\"\"\"\n        Based on an audio from a lecture of data mining, provide the following:\n        Enrich and give more context explaining the concepts discussed in the lecture from the segment: {start_segment} to {end_segment}.\n        The complete transcript and a version of it only for the specified segment.\n        \"\"\"\ninput_prompt = [example_audio, task]\nstruct_response_audio, logs_audio_struct = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = input_prompt, schema=AudioAnalysis, with_tokens_info = True)\n\n\nstruct_audio_resp_dict = json.loads(struct_response_audio)\nprint(logs_audio_struct)\nprint(struct_audio_resp_dict)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T09:54:25.843119Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T09:54:25.843594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.283779Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T09:54:25.843569Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.282624Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display(Markdown(f\"**Explanation:**<br> {struct_audio_resp_dict['explanation']}\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.284555Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.284799Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.291833Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.284781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.290168Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for timestamp_text in struct_audio_resp_dict[\"segment_transcript\"]:\n    print(f\"{timestamp_text['timestamp']} --- {timestamp_text['text']}\\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.292792Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.293135Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.317042Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.293091Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.315172Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for timestamp_text in struct_audio_resp_dict[\"complete_transcript\"]:\n    print(f\"{timestamp_text['timestamp']} --- {timestamp_text['text']}\\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.317957Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.318211Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.338545Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.318193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T09:54:37.337859Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n##### <a id='toc1_2_5_3_1_'></a>[**>>> Bonus 3 (Take home):**](#toc0_)\n\nUse the example of the prompt in `section 1.1.3 Text + Audio`, but change it to use video as the input, the same way as in `section 1.1.2 Text + Video`.

These methods are powerful for turning an LLM's understanding into a machine-readable format. However, as we build more complex applications, two critical challenges emerge: **trust** and **scalability**.\n\n1.  **Trust and Verifiability (Grounding):** How can we be sure the information an LLM provides is accurate and actually comes from the source text we gave it? LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or infer information that isn't present. **Grounding** is the process of linking every piece of extracted data directly back to its specific origin in the source document. This creates a verifiable audit trail, allowing a human or another system to confirm the information's source, which is essential in high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, and legal analysis.\n\n2.  **Scalability and Reliability (Extraction):** While function calling is excellent for specific tasks, building a robust pipeline to extract complex information from long, messy documents requires a more specialized approach. We need a system that can handle large texts, consistently enforce a desired output schema across thousands of documents, and make the results easy for humans to review.\n\nThis is where specialized libraries for information extraction come in, providing a framework that prioritizes both grounding and reliable structuring of data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n#### <a id='toc1_2_7_1_'></a>[**`langextract`: A Library for Grounded Extraction**](#toc0_)\n\nGoogle's open-source Python library, `langextract`, is designed specifically to solve these problems. It uses the power of LLMs to convert unstructured text into structured data, with a strong emphasis on reliability and traceability. Instead of just getting a JSON object, `langextract` provides a complete solution for building trustworthy extraction pipelines.\n\nHere are its key features:\n\n*   **Precise Source Grounding:** This is the library's core strength. Every single piece of extracted data is mapped to its exact character position in the original text. This means you can always trace an output back to its source, building trust and allowing for easy verification.\n*   **Reliable Structured Outputs:** We define the structure of our desired output by providing a few examples (few-shot prompting). `langextract` uses these examples to guide the LLM, ensuring the output consistently follows our defined schema. This makes the data clean, predictable, and ready for analysis or storage.\n*   **Adaptable to Any Domain without Fine-Tuning:** We don't need to collect a large dataset or retrain a model. By simply changing our natural language instructions and examples, you can adapt `langextract` to new domains, whether it's extracting clinical data from medical notes, key clauses from legal contracts, or financial figures from earnings reports.\n*   **Optimized for Long Documents:** The library is built to handle lengthy texts that might exceed a standard LLM's context window. It employs smart chunking and multi-pass strategies to effectively find \"needles in a haystack\" within large documents.\n*   **Flexible LLM Support:** `langextract` is model-agnostic.
